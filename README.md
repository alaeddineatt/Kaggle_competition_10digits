# Kaggle_competition_10digits
ranked first out of 52, scoring accuracy = 98,412%, applying convolutionnal neural network (Tensorflow, keras)
the main subject of this project is to train a model that can recognize handwriting digit, using data more complicated than mnist 
i have used Google Colabto take  advantage  of  the  free GPU that they offer,here in this link  https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#  you can learn how to interact with this work environment
